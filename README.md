# Bust-Ticketing-System

## Background and Introduction

A bus ticketing system is an application that allows users to book bus tickets online. It provides various facilities such as checking ticket availability, booking tickets, and processing payment transactions. The application generates a unique QR code as the ticket, which is scanned at the entrance of the bus to allow valid passengers inside. The application has two accounts: an admin account and a user account. The admin account can recharge user balances and view all processed tickets, while the user account allows users to search and book tickets by specifying a source and destination. Payment can be made through the application wallet, bank account, or online banking apps.
